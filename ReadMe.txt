Venantes is mod to help the Hunter manage the aspects, tracking, traps 
and pet spells, potions, drink/food and messages.

It provides a variety of buttons for common spells in an easy-to-use, 
small, convinient package.

The idea was adapted from Serenity and Necrosis LdC to make 
it usable by hunters. I needed something like it for my hunter :-)

Venantes will provide you a sphere and 10 buttons. The sphere will 
display information and the outer buttons will provide quick access 
for several things.

Venantes is splitted into 3 mods.

VenantesOptions - configuration dialog
SphereLoader - loads Venantes only if the toon is a hunter
